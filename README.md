# sd-reactor-api-unity-project
This project uses Unity to integrate the Reactor API of the Stable Diffusion web UI.
Users must run the Stable Diffusion web UI in advance and connect a webcam to the PC. You will also need to purchase and import AVPro Live Camera and Best HTTP paid assets. Tested on Windows, but not on Mac.

To run a program, use Assets/Scenes/MainScene.unity
